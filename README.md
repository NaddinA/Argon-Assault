# Argon-Assault
This is a classic railshooter game and all I had to do was implement some basic code for scene re/loading and music player handler, as well as collision handlers and 
a player controller script. This game is not as code-heavy as realm rush because of unity's utility functionalities. 
I may have needed a waypoint script to control the direction of where my player + enemies are flying, if it wasn't for unity's timeline.
All in all I decided to upload it anyway even though I put more effort in level design than programming in this game, because I didn't need to.
